## Overview:

**Joinin** came from the idea of doing a hobby (reading book at a coffee shop, going to a concert, jogging in a park, etc.) with other people and making new friends along the way. Itâ€™s different than a normal social dating app in a way that you make new company from an activity or event that you all participated in together. Usually from a normal social dating app, you meet people from online first and then decide a place to go based on mutual interest.
This social meetup app can allow user to meet and make new friends with people in nearby location.
